# Finding dominant Colors In and Image

1. K-Means

    K-Means can efficiently differentiate colors (Implement color segmentation) and with advanced methods K-Means is highly efficient. But, K-Means being a machine learning algorithm, it  may not be deterministic (We might not get correct result everytime)
